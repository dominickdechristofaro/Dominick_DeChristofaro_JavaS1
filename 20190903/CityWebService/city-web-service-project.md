# City List Design-and-Build Activity

In this activity, you will design and build a REST API based on the specification below. This specification is intentionally vagueâ€”this activity will force you to think about the design of the application and to ask good questions about the requirements.

## Requirements

* This application must keep track of city information.
* It must track the following data about cities:
    * Name
    * State
    * Population
    * Whether or not the city is a state capital
* The API must allow the user to do the following:
    * Add a city
        * URI: /city
        * Method: POST
        * Request Body: City
        * Response Body: City
    * Delete a city by name
        * URI: /city/{name}
        * Method: DELETE
        * Request Body: None
        * Response Body: None
    * Retrieve all the cities
        * URI: /city
        * Method: GET
        * Request Body: None
        * Response Body: City List
    * Retrieve one city by name
        * URI: /city/{name}
        * Method: GET
        * Request Body: None
        * Response Body: City
* Test this application using Postman.
* The Jackson mapper converts Lists to JSON automatically.
* The initial version of this application must store all data in memory. A later version must persist the data to file using one of the techniques shown in class.

Design and document a REST API that supports these requirements and then implement that web service using Spring Boot.

## Deliverables

1. OpenAPI 3.x documentaion of your REST API.
1. Pivotal Tracker project.
1. Spring-Boot-based web service that implements your API.
