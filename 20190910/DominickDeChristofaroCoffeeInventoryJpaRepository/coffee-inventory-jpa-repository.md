# Coffee Inventory DAO

This project involves the creation of a Spring Data JPA Repository and database using a code-first aproach.

## Structure
Your solution must have the following structural elements:

* Your solution must be in an IntelliJ project called ```FirstnameLastCoffeeInventoryJpaRepository``` where Firstname and Lastname are your first and last name respectively.
* Your solution must use Spring Data JPA.
* Your solution must contain a full set of unit/integration tests.

## Methodology

* Use a code-first approach to this project. Create your Java objects, annotate them, and let Spring Data JPA create your database.
* You must use Pivotal Tracker to track your tasks for this project.

## Requirements/Features

This project is a Spring Data JPA repository and relational database that keeps track of coffee in inventory. 

* Your DAO API must allow callers to create, read, read all, update, and delete Coffees and Roasters in the system. The system must also allow callers to find Coffees by Roaster, Coffees by Type, and Coffees by Roaster and Type.
